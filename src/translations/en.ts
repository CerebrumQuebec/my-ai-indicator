  futureFaqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions",
  futureFaqQuestion1:
    "How will Badge AI determine the exact level of AI involvement?",
  futureFaqAnswer1:
    "Future creative software will include Badge AI integration that monitors the creative process in real-time. It will track which operations are performed by AI and which by humans, calculating a precise contribution percentage for each component of the work. These metrics will then determine the appropriate badge level automatically.",
  futureFaqQuestion2:
    "What prevents someone from manually changing their Badge AI level?",
  futureFaqAnswer2:
    "The Badge AI metadata will include cryptographic signatures tied to the content hash. This creates a tamper-evident system where any modification to either the badge or the content would invalidate the signature. Verification tools will be able to detect such tampering.",
  futureFaqQuestion3:
    "How will Badge AI handle content that uses multiple types of AI?",
  futureFaqAnswer3:
    "The metadata specification supports detailed component-level tracking. For example, an image might list separate AI contribution percentages for composition, color grading, and object generation, each potentially using different AI tools.",
  futureFaqQuestion4: "Will Badge AI create extra work for creators?",
  futureFaqAnswer4:
    "No, the vision is for Badge AI to work invisibly in the background. Once integrated into creative software, it will automatically track AI usage and assign the appropriate badge without requiring any additional steps from creators.",
  futureFaqQuestion5:
    "How will Badge AI metadata persist across file formats and platforms?",
  futureFaqAnswer5:
    "The Badge AI protocol will define standard embedding methods for all major file formats. Additionally, platforms that display content will recognize and preserve this metadata when content is uploaded, shared, or modified.",
  futureFaqQuestion6: "What happens if content is modified after it's badged?",
  futureFaqAnswer6:
    "When properly integrated, editing software will update the Badge AI metadata in real-time as modifications are made. If the AI contribution level changes due to edits, the badge will be automatically adjusted to reflect the new balance.",
